This project is a port of the famous Free Admin Bootstrap Theme [SB Admin v2.0](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin-2/) to React.js Theme based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) using ES6 & Webpack.

## Available Scripts

No configuration or complicated folder structures, just the files you need to build your app.<br>
Once the installation is done, you can run some commands inside the project folder:

## Installation
#### 1. Clone this project or Download that ZIP file

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mberneti/react-admin.git
```

#### 2. Make sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) installed globally

More details [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)


#### 3. On the command prompt run the following commands

```sh
$ cd `project-directory`
```
```sh
$ npm install
```

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000/ReactAdmin/](http://localhost:3000/ReactAdmin/) to view it in the browser.

Note: The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

#### 2 Or Login as a User with `12345` verification key

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.<br>
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

[Read more about testing.](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#running-tests)

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
By default, it also [includes a service worker](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app) so that your app loads from local cache on future visits.

Your app is ready to be deployed.
